                <img src="images/rickaimeme.jpg"> <br><br> <p class="my-intro">
                    Ever since I started learning to program, I have always
                    wondered if books were really that useful. I always thought
                    not having the ability to see the code running physically
                    was a bad thing. I am not a CS student but an Aerospace
                    Engineering one. The thing is, I didn't know that I liked
                    programming at first, until around the end of my 2nd year
                    of college. It started with Basics of Python in one of the
                    college courses. That was when I really started to get into
                    programming. Back then It was a lot of YouTube learning,
                    experimenting,  and Google searching. Didn't even know
                    about stack overflow back then. Then Mr. GPT came around
                    just in time. But umm..., yeah that's the problem.<br><br>

                    Realizing what Mr. GPT can do really gave a turn to how I
                    was learning to program. At this time, I was already
                    jumping into JavaScript. I had a book about the
                    fundamentals of JavaScript and read the whole thing. But
                    why did I still find myself going to Mr. GPT when I got
                    stuck? Yes, I was taking some courses, but I just felt like
                    I wanted to build something straight away and just find out
                    about it later. I knew I had the knowledge and resources
                    available to do so. From YouTube tutorials to advanced
                    ones, creating projects after projects just to realize I
                    could not do it from scratch at all. Give me a blank HTML,
                    CSS, and JS file, and I would just sit and stare into the
                    blank vim pages.<br><br>

                    This is because every time I start building something, it's
                    usually already set up. The so-called Tutorial Hell. You
                    will start to see how this Tutorial Hell links up with Mr.
                    GPT. It was because I lacked the muscle memory to think and
                    plan a project from scratch. Everything was about
                    tutorials. The fear of trying, I would say, was holding me
                    back quite a bit. Fear that the things I write may not work
                    or something would break and it would take centuries to
                    fix. But isn't that the point of it all? To write and not
                    know anything about it. Then come back next time with what
                    we now know.<br><br>

                    This was when I decided to just jump in and build projects
                    from scratch with no help. At this point, I practiced
                    myself through it enough to build something from a blank
                    page. I made a mistake, learn and repeat enough times to
                    now know what I need to setup a project. Now came the
                    problem during the logical thinking and other functions you
                    have to create inside your projects to paste your ideas out
                    into code. I was clueless again.<br><br>

                    I'll let you guess the first thing I did when this happened.<br><br>
                </p>

                <div class="inline-wrapper">
                    <div class="item item7"><i class="fa-solid fa-robot custom-size" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>Mr GPT</div>
                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p class="my-intro"> I went straight to Mr. GPT, who had now
                    had quite a few updates. I don't remember exactly why I did
                    this. I think it was because of how powerful the GPT trend
                    was at that time and I just decided to go for it. Yes, I
                    had that amazing book which I did not fully realize until
                    later on.<br><br>

                    And so I was smashing through everything, every question I
                    had during the project. Every error I got, every single
                    thing I was stuck on such as how do I grab this from this,
                    and by this I meant copying the damn code and pasting it
                    for Mr. GPT, prompting it to follow my commands lul. Mr.
                    GPT did solve it all. It made me feel like a Chad
                    Programmer. I got sucked into this GPT hell. Do you see how
                    it's the same as Tutorial Hell? Little did I know, some
                    parts of it were wrong and sometimes it just did not work.
                    I would waste time looking at it ,not understand anything
                    and ask GPT to write a new one. But all I did was copy the
                    same thing and tell GPT about the problem. I would redo
                    this a bunch until I got the correct one, prompting it
                    continuously. This was when I knew that this isn't going to
                    work. How am I ever going to learn how to write it on my
                    own if I don't even know what the hell went wrong with it?
                    How would I know to think logically by looking at all the
                    arrays, objects, functions, const, booleans, classes and
                    create the thing I want the code to do? It wasn't effective
                    at all. Yes, it did solve a lot of problems I had and these
                    were basic problems. But it never made me better. It only
                    made me better at asking GPT to give me a good correct
                    answer üòë. I tried re-doing the whole same project over and
                    I still got stuck in the same places, having no muscle
                    memory of what Mr. GPT told me because it was just a bunch
                    of copy and paste. Its not just this one project. I even
                    went on experimenting with many of the projects I wanted to
                    make but never really progressing much. Very little reading
                    and understanding of the code itself.

                    <br>
                    <img src="images/spiderman.gif">
                    <br>

                    I knew I had to get out of this GPT Hell. So I just avoided
                    it for the rest of my learning period with no date on when
                    Im going to come back to it. Until I understood some of the
                    JavaScript stuff myself, then only I realized that Mr. GPT
                    can actually be useful in some cases. I had trouble
                    remembering what parameters a method in JavaScript takes.
                    Yes, now this is when Mr. GPT can be very useful. It can
                    explain to you clearly what this function does, what
                    parameters it takes, that this is an array method that
                    returns or that does not return. Then you write it out and
                    implement it further on your own with what you wanna build.
                    That's how you actually learn and remember. Of course there
                    are more examples but this is just one of them.<br><br>

                    What I am trying to say is, don't let Mr. GPT take over.
                    You should take over Mr. GPT. Use it effectively, not
                    simultaneously whenever you get stuck.<br><br>

                    I got to the phase where the more I used GPT to understand
                    how classes and constructors work + researches from Mdn
                    websites,a bunch of other websites and so on, putting those
                    things to work onto my own code, I find myself relying less
                    and less on Mr. GPT as time goes on. It's like you look at
                    a specific tutorial once and then it's gone once you master
                    it. That's when I totally removed Mr. GPT from my browser
                    bookmarks.<br><br>

                    I am only really using GPT when I already understand what
                    I'm doing and I only need quick clarification on things I
                    don't remember or understand.I'm not asking it to give me a
                    code to fetch an API or something like that ever. You get
                    the point. That's how you should prompt it. With things
                    that you are already somewhat familiar with. Don't just go
                    around telling it to do something for you when you yourself
                    don't even have a clue whether GPT is giving a correct
                    answer or not. It was a lesson learned. There were times
                    during my internship where I did not even wanna rely on Mr.
                    GPT because I was worried about the security issues. The
                    code Mr. GPT provides are not 100% right and it would
                    totally replace the reason I was doing internship in the
                    first place. Just so you see the real picture when using
                    GPT in real life. Sometimes the stuff is literally too
                    complex for it to even understand. I found this out when I
                    was testing out the new version of GPT to see what its
                    capable of and clear enough, with real world tasks. It
                    still never made it to my browser bookmark during that
                    whole 6 months.

                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>

                    With that said, I find myself looking and learning from the
                    first JavaScript book I read by O'Reilly. Starting to see
                    even more things I missed during the first read through.
                    Somehow I found a way to read and experiment with it. It
                    totally changed my perspective on thinking that "Are books
                    really that useful when you can't physically instantly see
                    what results you are getting?" But you can, just gotta put
                    the work in. Maybe I was just dumb back then lmao. I would
                    say learning how JavaScript works in real code and then
                    coming back to reread the book was a totally different
                    experience from reading it the first time. Suddenly, it's
                    as if more useful information just appeared. It could be
                    that I didn't read it as clearly during my first go
                    through, but I'm sure there are people like me out
                    there.<br><br>

                    Google, by the way, was the most helpful. The developer
                    community is so wide and helpful. You can literally find
                    anything if you know how to look for it. It will take some
                    time to master this skill of finding what you want. But as
                    you go on this journey, it will come to you eventually. You
                    will be surprised with how much there is out there.<br><br>

                    Some may say, well, searching and looking for these things
                    on Google takes too much time and I don't have that kind of
                    time. Believe me, Mr. GPT isn't faster either. Solutions
                    you find on the internet such as Stack Overflow may not
                    exactly be like your code, but this is when it forces you
                    to re-implement it into your own code. You could be reading
                    through some solution and knowing which is the one you want
                    and which isn't. You learn something from that. The
                    different ways things can be written to achieve the same
                    thing. Compared to Mr. GPT, prompting without knowing will
                    just give you a wrong solution that you just copy and
                    paste. Then you are left wondering what went wrong. This
                    leads you to do the same repetitive task with Mr. GPT until
                    you get it right. How boring is that? You don't learn
                    anything and you're giving yourself a reason to make
                    programming not fun when it can be fun.<br><br>

                    Going around discovering the solutions with multiple ways
                    of doing is fun. It forces you to read and understand those
                    lines of code. There is the fun factor in having to
                    discover it. It's a skill that I would say has so many
                    advantages that I am very confident everyone can be quick
                    with as your journey goes on. </p> <br><br>

                <h3>The Outside AI Perception</h3> <p class="my-intro"> I have
                    been talking with a lot of my friends inside and outside
                    the Tech Industry. A couple of us seem to be dealing with
                    the question, "Isn't there an AI that can do it all?"
                    <br><br> I myself have had this thrown at me as well, not
                    in an offensive way, but more in a way where people just
                    don't know the reality of it. Many of us who are like me,
                    just coming into this industry, seem to have faced these
                    types of questions from others outside the industry.
                    <br><br> <img src="images/leviosa.gif"> <br><br> I guess
                    it's just the effect of AI. Everyone outside seems to think
                    it's easy and advantageous to be a software engineer in
                    this era because of ads that show off what AI can do. Yeah,
                    it can be quite powerful, but I wouldn't say it's easy. It
                    takes a lot of time and effort to build up that raw skill.
                    Time is like your best friend here but at the same time
                    your enemy. <br><br> It can be easy, but knowing the
                    downsides of it, why would you do it? Plus, AI is not as
                    effective as people outside the industry think it is. I
                    mean, try sitting and prompting it for hours and hours,
                    then you will see how useless it can be sometimes. <br><br>
                    It's just something that some of us new developers have to
                    deal with and live with. I've also seen a big rise of
                    people joining the industry from somewhere.I don't remember
                    exactly where. I could be wrong, but just because AI is
                    able to do so many things, personally, I don't think it can
                    take over the industry. Especially Senior Devs, AI would
                    never replace them. <br><br> I see AI being implemented
                    into a lot of the simpler to more complex tasks in the
                    future, but I don't see it replacing anything fully anytime
                    soon.
